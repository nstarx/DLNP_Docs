# Federated Learning

## Overview

Federated Learning (FL) is an advanced distributed machine learning framework within the NStarX platform that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train AI models while keeping their data decentralized and private. This privacy-preserving approach allows organizations to benefit from collective intelligence without sharing sensitive raw data, making it ideal for industries with strict data privacy requirements such as healthcare, finance, and telecommunications.

The platform implements state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms that handle the complexities of distributed training, including non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, varying computational capabilities across clients, unreliable network connections, and Byzantine failures. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques and differential privacy mechanisms, the system ensures that model updates reveal minimal information about individual data points while still enabling effective collaborative learning. This approach has been proven to achieve model performance comparable to centralized training while maintaining strict privacy guarantees.

## Purpose

Federated Learning addresses critical challenges in modern AI development:

- **Data Privacy**: Train models without centralizing sensitive data
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy regulations
- **Cross-Organization Collaboration**: Enable joint learning across organizational boundaries
- **Edge Computing**: Leverage computation at the data source
- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep data within jurisdictional boundaries
- **Reduced Data Transfer**: Minimize bandwidth usage and costs
- **Real-time Learning**: Update models with fresh data at the edge

## Key Features

### 1. Distributed Training Management

#### Training Orchestration
- **Server-Client Architecture**: Central server coordinates distributed clients using a hub-and-spoke model where the server maintains the global model and orchestrates training rounds. The server handles client registration, authentication, model distribution, update collection, and aggregation. Supports both synchronous rounds where all clients must complete before aggregation and asynchronous updates for improved efficiency. The architecture scales to thousands of clients with built-in load balancing and fault tolerance.
- **Round-based Training**: Organized training rounds with configurable parameters including round duration, minimum client participation, convergence criteria, and early stopping conditions. Each round consists of client selection, model distribution, local training, update collection, secure aggregation, and global model update. The system tracks detailed metrics for each round including participation rates, training times, model improvements, and resource utilization.
- **Client Selection**: Smart selection algorithms for optimal participant choice based on factors like data quality, computational capacity, network reliability, and historical contribution. Supports random selection for unbiased training, reputation-based selection for reliable clients, resource-aware selection to balance load, and contribution-based selection to reward valuable participants. Includes fairness mechanisms to ensure all clients get opportunities to participate.
- **Aggregation Strategies**: Multiple model aggregation methods:
  - Federated Averaging (FedAvg): Standard weighted averaging based on client dataset sizes, with support for momentum and adaptive learning rates
  - Federated Proximal (FedProx): Handles system heterogeneity with proximal terms that limit model divergence between rounds
  - Federated Optimization (FedOpt): Advanced optimization techniques including FedAdam, FedYogi, and FedAdagrad for improved convergence
  - Custom aggregation algorithms: Plugin architecture for implementing domain-specific aggregation strategies with full access to client metadata and updates

#### Training Configuration
- **Hyperparameter Management**: Centralized control of training parameters
- **Client Requirements**: Define minimum hardware and software specifications
- **Data Requirements**: Specify dataset criteria and validation rules
- **Communication Protocols**: Efficient model update transmission

### 2. Client and Node Management

#### Client Registration
- **Automated Onboarding**: Streamlined client registration process
- **Identity Verification**: Secure client authentication and authorization
- **Capability Assessment**: Validate client resources and compatibility
- **Location Tracking**: Geographic distribution visualization

#### Node Configuration
- **Hardware Specifications**: CPU, GPU, memory requirements
- **Software Dependencies**: Framework versions and library requirements
- **Network Configuration**: Bandwidth, latency, and connectivity settings
- **Storage Management**: Local model and data storage allocation

#### Client Monitoring
- **Real-time Status**: Live client health and availability tracking
- **Performance Metrics**: Training speed, accuracy, resource usage
- **Error Detection**: Automatic identification of failing clients
- **Contribution Tracking**: Measure each client's impact on model quality

### 3. Privacy and Security Features

#### Differential Privacy
- **Noise Addition**: Calibrated noise injection for privacy guarantees using Gaussian, Laplace, or custom noise distributions. The system automatically calculates the appropriate noise scale based on the sensitivity of the function, the desired privacy level, and the number of training rounds. Supports both local differential privacy (noise added by clients) and central differential privacy (noise added by server). Includes advanced composition theorems for tracking privacy budget across multiple rounds.
- **Epsilon Configuration**: Adjustable privacy budget (ε) settings with support for heterogeneous privacy requirements where different clients can have different privacy levels. The platform provides privacy accountants that track cumulative privacy loss using RDP (Rényi Differential Privacy) and zCDP (zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy) for tighter bounds. Includes tools for converting between different privacy definitions and visualizing privacy-utility tradeoffs.
- **Noise Multiplier**: Fine-tune privacy-utility tradeoff with adaptive noise scaling that adjusts based on model convergence, client participation rates, and data characteristics. Supports gradient clipping to bound sensitivity, adaptive clipping for better utility, and per-layer privacy budgets for neural networks. The system includes optimization algorithms that jointly optimize for privacy and utility.
- **Per-client Privacy**: Individual privacy level configuration allowing each participant to specify their own privacy requirements based on data sensitivity and regulatory constraints. Supports privacy amplification through subsampling, where selecting a subset of clients provides additional privacy guarantees. Includes mechanisms for privacy budget negotiation and fair allocation across heterogeneous participants.

#### Secure Aggregation
- **Encrypted Updates**: Model updates encrypted during transmission
- **Secure Multi-party Computation**: Aggregate without decryption
- **Masking Protocols**: Hide individual contributions
- **Verification Mechanisms**: Ensure aggregation integrity

#### Additional Privacy Techniques
