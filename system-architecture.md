# System Architecture

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive architectural diagrams and documentation for the NStarX Data Lake and Neural Platform (DLNP) system architecture, including the complete system overview, data flow patterns, deployment sequences, and RAG architecture.

## System Components

### Client Layer
- **Web Client**: Browser-based user interface
- **API Client**: Programmatic API access
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for developers

### API Gateway
- **FastAPI Server**: High-performance async API server
- **CORS Middleware**: Cross-origin resource sharing handler

### Core Services
- **AI Converge Builder**: AI model convergence service
- **Deployment Manager**: Handles model and service deployments
- **RAG Manager**: Retrieval-augmented generation management
- **Chat Manager**: Chat session and conversation management
- **MLflow Manager**: Experiment tracking and model registry
- **Cost Estimator**: Resource cost estimation service
- **SSE Manager**: Server-sent events for real-time updates

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Kubernetes API**: Container orchestration
- **MinIO Storage**: S3-compatible object storage
- **MLflow Server**: ML experiment tracking
- **Custom Resources**: Kubernetes CRDs for platform resources

### Storage Systems
- **Model Artifacts**: Trained model storage
- **Experiment Metrics**: Training and evaluation metrics
- **Application Logs**: System and application logging

## Data Flow Architecture

The platform implements a comprehensive data flow architecture with the following layers:

### API Layer
- FastAPI endpoints for all platform operations
- RESTful API design with OpenAPI documentation

### Service Layer
- Chat Manager for conversation handling
- Deployment Manager for model deployments
- RAG Manager for retrieval operations
- MLflow Manager for experiment tracking

### Data Processing
- Session Store for user sessions
- Task Queue for async operations
- Response Cache for performance optimization

### Persistence
- Kubernetes etcd for configuration
- MinIO Object Store for artifacts
- MLflow Tracking for experiments

### Monitoring
- Prometheus Metrics collection
- Log Aggregation with centralized logging
- Event Stream for real-time monitoring

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment system implements a complete CI/CD pipeline with the following sequence:

1. **Deployment Creation**
   - User initiates deployment via API
   - Deployment Manager creates Kubernetes resources
   - Pods are scheduled and initialized
   - Model artifacts pulled from MinIO
   - Service becomes available

2. **Deployment Updates**
   - Rolling update strategy
   - Zero-downtime deployments
   - Automatic rollback on failure

## RAG Architecture

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation system consists of:

### Input Processing
- User query parsing
- Text embedding generation

### Retrieval System
- Vector database for semantic search
- Document retriever for context

### Generation Pipeline
- Context builder for prompt construction
- Language model for response generation
- Response formatting and delivery

### Infrastructure Support
- RAG Manager for orchestration
- Kubernetes CRDs for resource management
- MinIO storage for document persistence

## Architecture Principles

1. **Cloud-Native**: Built on Kubernetes for scalability
2. **Microservices**: Loosely coupled service architecture
3. **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing with event streams
4. **API-First**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specifications
5. **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
6. **Resilient**: Self-healing with automatic recovery
7. **Secure**: Multi-layer security with authentication and authorization
