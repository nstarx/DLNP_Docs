    category: string;
    provider: string;
    version: string;
    tags: string[];
    rating: number;
    reviewCount: number;
    pricing: {
        model: 'free' | 'freemium' | 'paid' | 'enterprise';
        cost: string;
    };
    deploymentOptions: ('cloud' | 'on-premise' | 'hybrid')[];
    features: string[];
    useCases: string[];
    techStack: string[];
    apiDocumentation: string;
    demoUrl: string;
    imageUrl: string;
    lastUpdated: string;
    popularity: number;
    performance: {
        accuracy: number;
        speed: number;
        scalability: number;
    };
}
```
